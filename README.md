LCARS Pebble Watchface
======================


This watch face is based on the look and feel of the Star Trek universe Library Computer
Access/Retrieval System (LCARS) computer system.

As well as displaying the current date and time on Earth, this watchface also displays
the current stardate and seconds past the "star day".

The "Earth time" output also respects the user setting indicating either 12hr or 24hr
display.
